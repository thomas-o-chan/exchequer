This repo is designed to demonstrate examples of various aspects of software development. It is not complete and in many cases only a single instance of a concept, such as tests, exist. This is not representative of how these aspects should be deployed in production environments.

## Accessibility and Responsiveness

The app has been designed to be largely accessible, conforming to a11y best practice where appliccable and was tested on a variety of emulated screen sizes. However, as a variety of physical devices were not available behaviour on actual smartphones may vary.

## Areas of improvement

- Test coverage
- Tests for frontend modules, using something like storybook
- CI pipelines
- Performance (particularly search)
- More colocated documentation
- Data validation
